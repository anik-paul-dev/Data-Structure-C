### **1. Pattern Matching Algorithms**

- **Pattern Matching Algorithm**
  - Implements basic pattern matching in a string.
- **Pattern Matching Algorithm (Optimized)**
  - Improved version with better complexity.

---

### **2. Array Operations**

- **Insert Element into Array**
  - Inserts an element at a specified position in an array.
- **Delete Element from Array**
  - Deletes an element at a specified position in an array.
- **Binary Search**
  - Finds the position of a specified element in a sorted array.

---

### **3. Sorting Algorithms**

- **Insertion Sort**
  - Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
- **Kth Largest Element**
  - Finds the Kth largest element in an array.
- **Relative Sort Array**
  - Sorts an array relative to another array.
- **Sort Array by Parity**
  - Sorts an array, grouping even numbers before odd numbers.

---

### **4. Linked List Operations**

- **Print Linked List**
  - Prints all elements in a linked list.
- **Insert Node**
  - Inserts a node at the beginning or end of a linked list.
- **Delete Node**
  - Deletes a node with a specific value.
- **Add Value to Elements**
  - Adds a given value K to each element in a linked list.

---

### **5. Stack Operations**

- **Stack Implementation**
  - Implements a stack using a linear array.
- **Postfix Expression Evaluation**
  - Evaluates a postfix expression using a stack.
- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**
  - Converts an infix expression to a postfix expression using a stack.

---

### **6. Queue Operations and Sorting**

- **Queue Implementation**
  - Implements enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Pre-order Traversal**
  - Implements pre-order traversal of a binary tree.
- **Quick Sort**
  - Sorts an array using the Quick Sort algorithm.

---

### **7. Binary Tree Operations**

- **In-order Traversal**
  - Implements in-order traversal of a binary tree.
- **Post-order Traversal**
  - Implements post-order traversal of a binary tree.
- **Search and Insert in BST**
  - Searches and inserts elements in a Binary Search Tree (BST).

---

### **8. Binary Search and Related Problems**

- **Binary Search**
  - Efficiently searches for a target element in a sorted array.
- **First and Last Occurrences**
  - Finds the first and last occurrences of a target in a sorted array.
- **Insert Position**
  - Determines the appropriate insert position for a target in a sorted array.
- **Peak Element**
  - Identifies a peak element in an array using Binary Search.

---

### **9. Tree Construction**

- **Construct Tree from Traversals**
  - Constructs a tree from given In-order and Pre-order traversals.
